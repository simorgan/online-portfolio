        <h1 class="heading">My Portfolio</h1>
        <p>Over the last two to three years, I have built little projects of my own gaining experience and confidents in web technologies, learning to push myself and experimenting with new ideas. Through this time, I have also picked up some freelance work, which has allowed me to gain some experience in the commercial side of web design and development. Please see some of my past projects below, these are just a few I have to offer, and I will add more finished product as they are finished. I all so have a <a href="https://github.com/simorgan" target="blank"><u><strong> GitHub </strong></u></a> with examples of code.</p>

                    <img src="images/holly-made-website.svg" alt="image showing a responsive website">
                    <p>This is a website build for a home-made cake business. This website was designed and developed to meet the customers themes and specification, as well as adding some movement to title headers using jQuery, where they will move in from the side as the users scrolls down the page. Languages used, HTML, CSS, jQuery and PHP. The contact forms have been designed with PHPmailer, which will mail inquiries to a business email plus sending an email to the user with an automated response, all built in HTML. All forms are validated with jQuery. To see a working demo please click <a href="https://www.projectsi.co.uk/test-builds/holly-made-cakes/" target="blank"><u><strong> here</strong></u></a>.    </p>

                    <img src="images/frome-rfc.svg" alt="image showing a responsive website">
                    <p>This is a project I help with as a volunteer role. I setup and provided training for Frome RFCâ€™s new CMS, as well as help manage the running on this website. The content of the website is added and managed internally, and I help with any functionalities beyond their scope. I have built a few pages and content with custom HTML and CSS offering a bit of customization to the website.

                    <h1>Frome RFC Club Portal</h1>
                   <i class="laravelImg fab fa-laravel"></i>
                    <p>This is a project I have undertaken for Frome RFC. This is still under construction and is being built using the Laravel framework. This is still in the design stage, and I am using Figma to prototype the layout and design. The main focus of this portal is to communicate all club membership information to committee members, but this will have added extras like an ecommerce, communication and organisation platforms. This will be built around user authorisation and permission level access. To see a very early working prototype please go <a href="http://simonmorgan1000.ddns.net/login" target="blank"><u><strong> here</strong></u></a>, but please note you will need to register to be able to gain access, please do not enter any personal data, and use a fictitious email like test@test.com.          </p>
